# 📊 Machine Learning Hackathon Project
## 📌 Overview

This project tackles the issue of highly correlated features in a dataset, which can lead to model overfitting. The objective is to develop an optimized machine learning model that can handle feature correlation effectively and improve generalization performance.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

The presence of highly correlated features in the dataset negatively impacts model performance by increasing overfitting. This project focuses on:

    Identifying correlated features
    Applying feature selection techniques
    Training a model with improved generalization

## 🔍 Approach

Data Preprocessing:
     
    Load and clean the dataset
    Identify and handle correlated features

  Feature Engineering:
   
    Apply transformation techniques
